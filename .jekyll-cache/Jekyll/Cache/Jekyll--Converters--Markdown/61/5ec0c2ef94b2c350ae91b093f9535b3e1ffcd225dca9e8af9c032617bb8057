I"ñ<p>Some tips that have worked for us:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Put bells on the bottom of your tree so youâ€™ll know if baby starts to mess with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get baby her own tree.
I ordered this bamboo tree from Ikea. I used solar camping lights to decorate it, which need to be plugged in, and I threaded them in the inside, not the outside. Then I wrapped it in baby safe bunting.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obvious, but donâ€™t hang ornaments within their reach on your tree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A moat of presents around the bottom prevents them from pulling down the branches.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Happy holidays!
